Git is a DevOps tool used for source code management. It is one of the most prominent version control systems (VCS) today that is widely used to handle small and large projects efficiently. It helps in tracking changes in source code, enabling different people to collaborate on different parts of the same program.

Before diving into our how Git works tutorial, let's understand a little more about what Git is in general.

What Is Git?
Git is a version control system for tracking changes in computer files. It helps in coordinating work amongst several people in a project and tracks progress over time. Unlike the centralized version control system, Git branches can be easily merged. A new branch is created every time a developer wants to start working on something. This ensures that the master branch always has a production-quality code.

Git is a distributed version control system, so here, every developer gets their local repository with full commit history. The commit history makes Git fast, as now a network connection is not needed to create commits or perform diffs between commits.

Now that we know more about Git let us explore GitHub.
